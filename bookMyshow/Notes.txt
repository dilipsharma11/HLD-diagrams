Functional Requirements:-
    -City ->Movie ->Theatre ->Time -> Seats
    -If number of seats are available, reserve them for the user until they are booked.
     If seats reserved but not booked, allow users to enter a FIFO waitlist in case they become free
    
    Capacity Estimates:-
        -5000 cities, 10 theatre per City
        -2000 seats per theater, 2 shows per day
        -50 bytes per row of booking data
        -5000*10*2000*2*50 bytes = 1gb/day

API design:-
    -getCities()
    -getMovies(cityId)
    -getTheatres(cityId, movieId)
    -bookSeats(showId, seatIds)

Database schema:-
    -Cities(id, name)
    -Movies(id, name, cityId)
    -Theatres(id, name, address, cityId)
    -MovieShow(movieId, TheatreId, time)
    -MovieSeats(id, showId, name, status)

shard on showId
