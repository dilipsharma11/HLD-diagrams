1. Traffic
    -Daily Active Users (users = number of requests)
        -read requests per day
        - write requests per day
    Convert both from per day to second
        - read per sec = read per day/no of seconds in a day


2. Storage
    - Convert everything to bytes
    - kilo : thousand    : 10^3
    - mega : million     : 10^6
    - giga : billion     : 10^9
    - tera : trillion    : 10^12
    - peta : quadrillion : 10^15

    Calculate for per day then multiply for years

3. Memory
    - 80 to 20 ratio for caching from storage
    - eg. 20% of 1 TB in cache

4. Bonus:-
    -Resource decision (How many servers needed to serve this load)
    - formula = requests per second to handle/ no of requests a single server can handle
    e.g if 1 request takes 0.5 second. in 1 second 2 requests can be served via a single core
    if there are 8 cores then 16 requests per second a server can serve
    - no of servers = 500/16 = 30 to 50 servers
