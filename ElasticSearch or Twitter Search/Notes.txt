Functional Requirements:-
    -Query plain text documents based on a combination of terms that appear in them

Capacity Esimates:-
    -400 million tweets per day 
    -300 bytes per tweet
    -120gb of tweets per day 
    -730 billion tweets per 5 years, 200 tb for 5 year
    -40 bits = 5 bytes per tweet id 
    -15 search terms per tweet 
    -55 TB of storage in index for 5 years 

No db schema. Thats what be building you idiot
When building database. Remove noise from the documents. words like a, an, and, ing etc
We can use apache lucene. It supports suffix, prefix and fuzzy search, Term frequency, Inverse term frequency etc 

Always ask if it should be global or local index
Here, local index is preferred because we are storing same documents in the same node. so faster retrieval. glocal index at this scale is not feasible 
We can shared them completely random or by time
