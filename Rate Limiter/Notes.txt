Functional Requirements:-
    -Limit an entity to a certain number of requests/api calls in a given amount of time
    - e.g 1000 limit in 10 seconds

Capacity Estimates:-
    -1 million users
    -8 bytes for userId
    -4 byte for timeStamp
    -4 byte counter
    -Limit of 100 requests per user
    -1 mil*(8+4+4) = 16mb if storing all request using a counter
    -1 mil*(100 requests) *(8+4 bytes) per request = 1.2gb if storing every single request

API:-
    - rate_limit(userId, api_endpoint, timeStamp)

No database:-
    -everything in Memory

Two types of rate limiter:-
    - fixed window
    - rolling window

There could be a possible race condition here but since we are using redis here for in memory storage and redis is single thread so we are good
Rate limit on both ip address and userId
